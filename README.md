A Study of Student Accommodation in London

Thank you for taking the time to view my project in data anaylsis and visualisation.

I would recommend starting off by reading the report for this project, titled 'Report.pdf', then progressing on to viewing the notebook 'Student Accommodation Notebook.ipynb' for more detail into the approaches I took.

In case the maps in the notebook do not show on GitHub, here is a direct link to the notebook on IBM Watson:

Thanks,
